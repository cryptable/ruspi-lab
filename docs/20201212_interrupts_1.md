Labo 3: Yet Another Bare metal Rust adventure
=============================================

Introduction
------------

This Labo will about investigating interrupts of the Raspberry Pi 4. We will also continue our testing investigation. Our process will be developing our labos on the qemu emulator, automated unittesting and debugging. We will debugging our Rust application using remote debugging into our Qemu session. The result of the unittesting must be reported back from the qemu session into my IDE (CLion).
We will need to perform conditional compiling to differentiate the Qemu environmen, Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi 4.
