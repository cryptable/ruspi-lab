Labo 2: Yet Another Bare metal Rust adventure
=============================================

Introduction
------------

Main focus now it testing the bare metal code. To setup the testing environment, we can use a Raspberry Pi 4, but this quite cumbersome. So we will test the code first with a simulator, which simulates Raspberry Pi 3 (not a 4 yet). This brings us to the memory mapping of the different Raspberry Pis. Which will also be described in this chapter. You can't attach a (virtual) LED to the simulator (yet), so how do we know it works. We will setup a serial communication channel to the host enviroment.

Memory mapping
--------------

Before starting the test environment with qemu and your Pi, I'm going to explain the memory layout of the Pi. In the documentation of [BCM2711](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2711/README.md) (BCM2711), you'll find in chapter 1 the memory layout of a Raspberry Pi 4. For the Raspberry Pi 3, you'll find the memory mapping in the same chapter of the document [BCM2835](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2835/README.md) (BCM2835). This is how the processor does the address mapping and doesn't really help, except if you try to write a new firmware for the Raspberry Pi, like the [Open Firmware project](https://github.com/christinaa/rpi-open-firmware) (Open Firmware).
The firmware delivered from Broadcom does also an address mapping to other regions and these must be found in the device trees of the [Raspberry Pi Linux kernel sources](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux).

1) Under directory **linux/arch/arm/boot/dts** you will find all the Device Tree files for the arm platform. To learn the memory address ranges for the periferals on the Raspberry Pi 4, you need to open the file **bcm2711.dtsi** and for the Raspberry Pi 3, it is the file **bcm2837.dtsi**. 

2) In the file is a section *soc*, which contain a *ranges* attribute. Here you find the address mapping ranges which will be available after the firmware loaded your kernel. For the Raspberry Pi4, it is:
```
  soc {
    /*
     * Defined ranges:
     *   Common BCM283x peripherals
     *   BCM2711-specific peripherals
     *   ARM-local peripherals
     */
    ranges = <0x7e000000  0x0 0xfe000000  0x01800000>,
       <0x7c000000  0x0 0xfc000000  0x02000000>,
       <0x40000000  0x0 0xff800000  0x00800000>;
    /* Emulate a contiguous 30-bit address range for DMA */
    dma-ranges = <0xc0000000  0x0 0x00000000  0x40000000>;
...
```
Here it is described that the address from 0x7e00000 with offset 0x0 is mapped to 0xFE000000 for a range of 0c0180000, the address from 0x7c00000 with offset 0x0 is mapped to 0xFc000000 for a range of 0c0200000 and 0x40000000 with offset 0x0 is mapped to 0xff800000 for a range of 0x00800000. 
This you'll have to remember, when you're using the address mapping of the periferals.
For example, in chapter 2 of (BCM2711), it is said the mini UART (UART1) and the 2 SPI master auxiliary register base address is 0x7e215000. In your Rust code this must be mapped to 0xFe215000

For the Raspberry Pi 1 and Pi 2, it is likewise, you open the dts or dtsi file of corresponding processors.

Testing
-------

### Raspberry Pi

To test with a Raspberry Pi 4, we had to use an sdcard with the Raspberry Pi OS on it, where we overwrite the kernel8.img file. Wouldn't it be better to make our own disk with the minimal files on it.
You're in your **.../ruspi-devenv** directory.

0) Make a directory disk
```
mkdir disk
cd disk
```

1) Create a 1Gb (512 * 2097152) disk file with **dd**. A FAT32 partition will take at least 32Mb for the file information
```
dd if=/dev/zero of=./sdcard.img bs=512 count=2097152
```

2) Setup the image as a partional loop device
```
sudo losetup --find --partscan --show ./sdcard.img
```
This command will return the /dev/loop0. Though the '0' can be another number.

3) Create the first partition of 256Mb as a FAT32 and bootable. The rest a Linux partition (unused for now)
```
sudo fdisk /dev/loop0
```

4) Format partition 1 as FAT32 with the label 'boot'
```
sudo mkfs -t vfat /dev/loop0p1
sudo fatlabel /dev/loop0p1 BOOT
```

5) Format partition 2 as ext2 with the label 'root'
```
sudo mkfs -t ext2 -L root /dev/loop0p2
```

6) Mount the boot partition to your filesystem
```
sudo mkdir /mnt/boot
sudo mount /dev/loop0p1 /mnt/boot
```

We will need the firmware to copy it onto the BOOT disk.

6) Download the firmware from raspberry Pi community
```
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware.git
```

7a) Raspberry Pi 4 B: Copy the necessary files to boot
```
sudo cp firmware/boot/bootcode.bin /mnt/boot
sudo cp firmware/boot/fixup4.dat /mnt/boot
sudo cp firmware/boot/start4.elf /mnt/boot
sudo cp firmware/boot/bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb /mnt/boot
```

7b) Raspberry Pi 3 B: Copy the necessary files to boot 
```
sudo cp firmware/boot/bootcode.bin /mnt/boot
sudo cp firmware/boot/fixup.dat /mnt/boot
sudo cp firmware/boot/start.elf /mnt/boot
sudo cp firmware/boot/bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb /mnt/boot
```

If you're working with another model, please consult the Raspberry Pi documentation, the section [The boot folder](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/boot_folder.md) (Boot).

8) Now you can copy the **config.txt** and the **kernel8.img** of a previous exercise on it.

9) Unmount the boot disk and burn it to an empty sdcard (at least 1Gb). Verify the device where the sdcard is mounted before executing following commands. Your data will be lost on the sdcard.
```
sudo umount /mnt/boot
sudo dd if=./sdcard.img of=/dev/sde bs=512
```

10) Test if your LED lights up.

Exercises:

1) Automate the process to create an sdcard image

2) Add the automation to your dev process in the Rust project

3)* Try to make the disk image without superuser/root permissions 


### QEMU testing 

qemu is able to simulate a Raspberry Pi3, but not a Raspberry Pi4, which are different when you're working in bare metal environment, because of the memory address mapping. You can install qemu from the your system repository (using apt-get or yum).

#### Install qemu from the source

```
cd devkit-build
wget https://download.qemu.org/qemu-5.2.0.tar.bz2
wget https://download.qemu.org/qemu-5.2.0.tar.bz2.sig

gpg --verify ./qemu-5.2.0.tar.bz2.sig 
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys CEACC9E15534EBABB82D3FA03353C9CEF108B584

tar xvf qemu-5.2.0.tar.bz2
rm qemu-5.2.0.*
mkdir qemu-build
cd qemu-build
../qemu-5.2.0/configure --prefix=/home/david/workspacehd/ruspi-devenv/devkit/
../qemu-5.2.0/configure --prefix=/home/david/workspacehd/ruspi-devenv/devkit/ --target-list=aarch64-softmmu,arm-softmmu
make
make check
make install
```

#### Testing with Qemu

You need to recompile the Raspberry Pi 4 code with the memory address base address of the Pi 3.

You can then execute the following command to run your bare-metal code:
```
cd ../ruspi-lab/r01_shine-in-darkness-rust
qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi3 -kernel ./target/aarch64-unknown-none/release/r01_shine-in-darkness-rust
```

This will do nothing, because you can't attach a LED to your qemu simulator. Next chapter will start outputting data to the console using the UART1 of Pi (GPIO pin 14 and 15, which can be simulated on the qemu simulator.

Exercises:

1) Automate the process to test with qemu after the build process

2)** Implement the Raspberry Pi 4 support in qemu-system-aarch64 (If not yet done)

3)** Implement a GPIO support in qemu with design

### Hello from planet Pi

We are going to start using the UART1 (see miniUART, SPI chapter 2 of (BCM2711)) to print messages from the GPIO pins 14 (Tx), 15 (Rx).
Here we are starting to recreate a new project, which will be based on the previous Rust project for the assembly file **start.s**, but the **main.rs** will be refactored. So you can copy the **start.s** file.

#### Create the project

We will reuse the files from the project r01. If you insist to recreate then, please verify how to do this in the previous project. 

##### Concise background information for cross compilation

To perform the cross compilation we already have installed the cargo extension **cargo-xbuild**. This will facilitate the building to Aarch64 much easier.
We already switched to the nightly edition of Rust to support the cross compilation to Aarch64.
The base **aarch64-unknown-none.json** was create by the rustc compiler to target aarch64-unknown-none, which means we target the CPU Aarch64, the OS is unknown and the platform is none, see the [Platform Support](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html) (Paltform) for more information.
You can also list the supported platform of the Rust compiler by running the command:
```
rustc --print target-list
```
If the *aarch64-unknown-none* target is already in the default release of Rust you don't need to switch to the nightly.

##### Setup the project

Thanks to the previous project we can easily setup a new project.

```
cd ../ruspi-lab
cargo new r02_hello-from-planet-pi --bin --edition 2018
cd r02_hello-from-planet-pi
cp ../r01_shine-in-darkness-rust/aarch64-unknown-none.json .
cp ../r01_shine-in-darkness-rust/config.txt .
cp ../r01_shine-in-darkness-rust/src/start.s src/
```

Exercise:

1) Automate the project creation with copying from a previous project (see the previous project)

#### Convince Rust project this is bare-metal

Open the **main.rs** and add the following line to explain we don't have the std library (damn!!!).
```
#![no_std]
```

And we don't have a main function (What!!!!):
```
#![no_main]
```

Add the following line to tell Rust we include Assembly language (Euuhh, I thought we will write in Rust). 
```
#![feature(global_asm)]
```

The *global_asm* feature is necessary to include our Assembly in **start.s**, which will start our *rmain* function in the Rust code. So we add the following code.
```
global_asm!(include_str!("start.s"));
```

What does the **start.s** do? Well open it:
1) Convince the linker to place this code first. Verify this with the section in the linker script.
```
.section ".text.start"
```
This means that when the ARM processor starts at memory location 0x00080000. It will find the binary version of the assembly language.
2) Make a \_start label for the linker to know what the ENTRY will be
```
.globl _start
 
_start:
```
3) Stop each core (for now at least), except core 0.
```
    // Stop all cores except core 0
    mrs     x1, mpidr_el1
    and     x1, x1, #3
    cbz     x1, 2f
1:   
    wfe
    b       1b
```

3) Zeroize your stack
```
2:
    ldr     x5, =_start
    mov     sp, x5
 
    // clear bss
    ldr     x5, =__bss_start
    ldr     w6, =__bss_size
3:  cbz     w6, 4f
    str     xzr, [x5], #8
    sub     w6, w6, #1
    cbnz    w6, 3b
```

4) Start you Rust main *rmain* to run the application
```
    // Jump into the C program
4:  bl      rmain

    // Stop the core when returned
    b       1b
```

Replace your 'pub fn main' with the following code
```

mod panic;
mod periferals;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn rmain() {

  let uart = periferals::uart1::Uart1::new();

  uart.puts("Hello from planet Pi!\n");

  loop {
    uart.putc(uart.getc());
  }
}
```

Your complete **main.rs** looks like:
```
#![no_std]
#![no_main]
#![feature(global_asm)]

global_asm!(include_str!("start.s"));

mod panic;
mod periferals;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn rmain() {

  let uart = periferals::uart1::Uart1::new();

  uart.puts("Hello from planet Pi!\n");

  loop {
    uart.putc(uart.getc());
  }
}
```

You bare-metal needs a panic handler. So add a **panic.rs** file in thë **src** directory with an *on_panic* function
```
use core::panic::PanicInfo;

#[panic_handler]
fn on_panic(_info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

At last you will need a modified linker.ld file, because Rust will have literals create with extension .rodata.sdsflljfsdjfklsd. This needs to be include in the binary generation during linking.
Your **linker.ld** file looks like:
```
ENTRY(_start)


SECTIONS
{
    . = 0x80000;
    .text :
    {
        KEEP(*(.text.start))
        *(.text .text.*)
    }
    . = ALIGN(32); /* align to page size */
 
    .rodata :
    {
        *(.rodata .rodata.*)
    }
    . = ALIGN(32); /* align to page size */
 
    .data :
    {
        *(.data .data.*)
    }
    . = ALIGN(32); /* align to page size */
 
    __bss_start = .;
    .bss :
    {
        bss = .;
        *(.bss .bss.*)
    }
    . = ALIGN(32); /* align to page size */
    __bss_end = .;
    __bss_size = __bss_end - __bss_start;
}
```

Cool, you have the bare basis to run the Rust bare metal communication program using the Uart1. 

#### The Periferals module

From a design model we will have a periferal module, which will contain the real Raspberry periferals described in (BCM2711). We will implement 2 kind of perfiferals:
1) GPIO support

2) miniUART support as UART1, which will use the GPIO support module

All periferals use some common modules for memory mapping and utilities containing some support functions.
All the functions will be put together into a library.

1) Create the library **lib.rs** in the **src** directory
```
#![no_std]
#![feature(global_asm)]

pub mod periferals;
```
The *global_asm* feature must be in the main parent file, if you want to use it in dependent file.

2) Create the *periferals* module with the creation of a **periferals** directory in the **src** directory

3) Create in the directory a **memmap.rs** file for the memory location of the perifierals.
```
// Raspberry Pi 3
pub const MMIO_BASE: u32   = 0x3F000000;
// Raspberry Pi 4
// pub const MMIO_BASE: u32   = 0xFE000000;
```

We defined 2 constants which can for now manual switched, one for the Raspberry Pi 3 and qemu support. The other is for the Raspberry Pi 4 with serial support for the UART.

##### The GPIO module

The GPIO module is used to enable and configure the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi. Open the documentation of (BCM2711) to understand the function we will describe in this section.
We have access to some library functions of the Rust compiler, namely the *core* module of Rust. There we use *unsafe* function to write directly to the memory mapped region of the GPIO system.

1) Create a **gpio.rs** in the *periferals* module containing following code
```
use core::ptr;
use crate::periferals::utils;
use crate::periferals::memmap::MMIO_BASE;

pub const GPFSEL0: *mut u32   = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200000) as *mut u32;
pub const GPFSEL1: *mut u32   = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200004) as *mut u32;
pub const GPFSEL2: *mut u32   = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200008) as *mut u32;
pub const GPFSEL3: *mut u32   = (MMIO_BASE + 0x0020000C) as *mut u32;
pub const GPFSEL4: *mut u32   = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200010) as *mut u32;
pub const GPFSEL5: *mut u32   = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200014) as *mut u32;
pub const GPSET0: *mut u32    = (MMIO_BASE + 0x0020001C) as *mut u32;
pub const GPSET1: *mut u32    = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200020) as *mut u32;
pub const GPCLR0: *mut u32    = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200028) as *mut u32;
pub const GPCLR1: *mut u32    = (MMIO_BASE + 0x0020002c) as *mut u32;
pub const GPLEV0: *mut u32    = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200034) as *mut u32;
pub const GPLEV1: *mut u32    = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200038) as *mut u32;
pub const GPEDS0: *mut u32    = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200040) as *mut u32;
pub const GPEDS1: *mut u32    = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200044) as *mut u32;
pub const GPHEN0: *mut u32    = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200064) as *mut u32;
pub const GPHEN1: *mut u32    = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200068) as *mut u32;
pub const GPPUD: *mut u32     = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200094) as *mut u32;
pub const GPPUDCLK0: *mut u32 = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00200098) as *mut u32;
pub const GPPUDCLK1: *mut u32 = (MMIO_BASE + 0x0020009C) as *mut u32;

pub fn gpio_set_fun(pin: u8, func: u8) {
 
  if pin >= 28 {
    // Error
    return;
  }
  if func >= 8 {
    // Error
    return;
  }

  let shift = (pin % 10) * 3;
  if pin < 10 {
    // we clear the 3 bits using !(7<<shift) for the function selection
    // we set the pin to output using (1<<shift)
    unsafe {
      let r = (ptr::read_volatile(GPFSEL0) & !((7 as u32)<<shift)) | ((func as u32)<<shift);
      ptr::write_volatile(GPFSEL0, r);
    }
    return;
  }

  if pin < 20 {
    unsafe {
      let r = (ptr::read_volatile(GPFSEL1) & !((7 as u32)<<shift)) | ((func as u32)<<shift);
      ptr::write_volatile(GPFSEL1, r);    
    }
    return;
  }

  unsafe {
    let r = (ptr::read_volatile(GPFSEL2) & !((7 as u32)<<shift)) | ((func as u32)<<shift);
    ptr::write_volatile(GPFSEL2, r);
  }

  // Success
  return

}

pub fn gpio_set_output(pin: u8, high: bool) {
 
  if pin >= 28 {
    // Error
    return;
  }

  if high {
    unsafe {
      ptr::write_volatile(GPSET0, 1<<pin);
    }
    return;
  }

  unsafe {
    ptr::write_volatile(GPCLR0, 1<<pin);
  }
  // Success
  return

}

pub fn gpio_set_pullup_pulldown(pin: u8, func: u8) {

  if pin >= 28 {
    // Error
    return;
  }
  if func >= 4 {
    // Error
    return;
  }

  unsafe {
    ptr::write_volatile(GPPUD, func as u32);
  }
  utils::delay(150);
  unsafe {
    ptr::write_volatile(GPPUDCLK0, 1<<pin);
  }
  utils::delay(150);
  unsafe {
    ptr::write_volatile(GPPUD, 0x0);
    ptr::write_volatile(GPPUDCLK0, 0x0);
  }

  // Success
  return
}
```

Error handling is still minimal, yet. In all fucntions we only support the pins on the GPIO interface, which is less than all the pins described in the (BCM2711). It is only to support the periferals on GPIO connector of the Raspberry Pi. The gpio registers from 0 to 27 are mapped to the GPIO connector on the Rapsberry Pi.
The first function *gpio_set_fun* will enable and set the kind of function the pin will perform using a 3 bit pattern (here it is an u8). We first clear the 3 bits on the location of the register and then we set it to the new function. The functions can vary and please refer to the BCM2711 documentation which pin can perform which function.
When a pin is set as an output-function, you can use the *gpio_set_output* function to set it high or low (3.3v). 
The last function *gpio_set_pullup_pulldown* will set the pullup or pulldown resistor support on the pin. It is done in a strange way and verify how in the documentation of (BCM2835).

2) You see the **gpio.rs** uses a delay utility function. This is delared in the **utils.rs** and **asmutils.s** file. This convinces me the loop is not optimized away.
- **utils.rs**
```
global_asm!(include_str!("asmutils.s"));

extern {
    fn asm_delay(t: isize);
}

pub fn delay(time: isize) {
  unsafe {
    asm_delay(time);
  }
}
```
- **asmutils.s**
```
.globl asm_delay

asm_delay:
    subs x0, x0, #1
    bne asm_delay
    ret
```

3) The **uart1.rs** contains the UART1 support to communicate using the serial port. Again look in the (BCM2711) to verify the memory mapping.
```
use core::ptr;
use crate::periferals::gpio;
use crate::periferals::memmap::MMIO_BASE;

/* Auxilary mini UART registers */
const AUX_IRQ: *mut u32         = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00215000) as *mut u32;

const AUX_MU_BAUD: *mut u32     = (MMIO_BASE + 0x00215068) as *mut u32;

pub struct Uart1 {
}

impl Uart1 {

      ptr::write_volatile(AUX_MU_BAUD, 541);    // 270 for Raspberry Pi3 (see calculation in BCM2711) and 541 for a Pi4
      ptr::write_volatile(AUX_MU_CNTL, 0x3);
    }

    return Uart1 {};

      let mut r = ptr::read_volatile(AUX_MU_LSR) & 0x20; // Transmitter empty?
      while r == 0x00 {
        r = ptr::read_volatile(AUX_MU_LSR) & 0x20;
      }
      ptr::write_volatile(AUX_MU_IO, c as u32);

The constructor **new** will configure the GPIO pin 14 as transmit pin and pin 15 as receive pin for the miniUART (UART1). Then it disables the pullup and pulldown resistor support on the pins. We enable and configure the UART1
The function putc puts a character in the FIFO when a place is available.
The function getc gets a character from the FIFO when there is a character.
The function puts will send a string.
The baudrate is for a Pi4 541 and for a Pi3 it is 270, because you need to perform a calculation as described in the (BCM2711), but you will not find the system clock of the Pi in that document. This can be found on the Raspberry site, which is GPU minimum core frequency on the [overclocking](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/overclocking.md) (Overclocking) page.

4) Create a **mod.rs** file which will assemble the whole module
```
mod memmap;
mod utils;
pub mod uart1;
pub mod gpio;
```

Excercises:

1) Use enumaration for the functions *gpio_set_fun* and *gpio_set_pullup_pulldown* for the *func* parameter to support strong typing.

2) In the *gpio_set_output* check if the pin was set as an output pin.

3) Refactor the gpio into an object.

4)* Automatic baudrate calculation.

#### Test the project with QEMU

QEMU today only supports the Raspberry Pi 3. This means in the **memmap.rs** file, you will need to adapt the address location to 0x3F000000.

1) Build the project
```
cargo xbuild --verbose --target=aarch64-unknown-none.json --release
```
2) Test with qemu. The first -serial argument is mapped to UART0, but we use UART1, so we need to add another -serial argument, which will be piped to **stdio**
```
qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi3 -kernel target/aarch64-unknown-none/release/r02_hello-from-plat-pi -serial null -serial stdio
```

It should print:
```
Hello from planet Pi!
```

#### Test the project with Raspberry Pi 4

To perform this test you'll need a USB-TTL cable to attach it to your Raspberry Pi 4 GPIO connector. Change in the **memmap.rs** file the address location to 0xFE000000.

1) Build the project
```
cargo xbuild --verbose --target=aarch64-unknown-none.json --release
```

2) Create your kernel8.img file
```
aarch64-none-elf-objcopy -O binary target/aarch64-unknown-none/release/r02_hello-from-planet-pi kernel8.img
```

3) Insert your sdcard and copy the **config.txt** and **kernel8.img** file to the BOOT partition of the sdcard created earlier.

4) We are going to add an overlay to enable the miniUART, because it is used by the bluetooth.
```
cd ../../disk
mkdir /media/david/BOOT/overlays
cp firmware/boot/overlays/miniuart-bt.dtbo /media/david/BOOT/overlays
```

5) Connect the USB-TTL cable to your Raspberry Pi 4. The receive cable goes into the Transmit pin GPIO pin 14 (pin 8 connector), the tranmit cable goes on the Receive pin GPIO pin 15 (pin 10 coinnector) and the ground cable goes to GPIO Ground (pin 6 connector). Don't attach the 5V cable. See (GPIO) for the details.

![Raspberry Pi 4 miniUART connection!](/docs/assets/images/uart1_connection_picture1.png?raw=true "UART1 connection")


6) run the **dmesg** app to check which tty the USB-TTL cable is connectoed to.
```
>dmesg | grep tty
[19132.579377] cp210x ttyUSB0: cp210x converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0
[19139.367825] usb 5-5: cp210x converter now attached to ttyUSB0
```

7) Use **minicom** or **screen** to connect to the tty port. Set the baudrate to 115200, No parity and 8bit data.

8) Insert sdcard and enable the Raspberry Pi 4.

It should print:
```
Hello from planet Pi!
```

If it doesn't work, try to switch transmit and receive cables.

Exercises:

1)** During boot you should find out the Raspberry Pi model and automatically set the memmap address.

Conclusion:
-----------

We have now 2 testing platforms to test our code, though the testing platform of qemu is limitted. We are now also able to communicate with our Raspberry Pi, which is also an achievement. 
The following labos wont include the code in such detail, because you can just checkout the code from the labos.
Next labo will about:
- auto-update using the miniUART
- memory management
